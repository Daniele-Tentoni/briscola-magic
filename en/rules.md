# Briscola Magic – Official Rules

## Supreme Rule

- **What [Fabione](https://www.lpfc.it/players/romagnolifabio/) says is always correct.**
- Anything Fabione declares can override any of the following rules.
- The game follows the normal Magic: The Gathering rules except where otherwise specified in this document.

---

## Game Materials

- No additional cards are allowed.

## Starting Setup

- Each player starts with **12 life points**.
- At the beginning of the game each player draws **3** cards from the main deck.
- Maximum hand size is **5**.

---

## Game Rules

1. **Land of the turn**:
   Each turn, a player may put one card from the **land deck** into play as their land for that turn.

2. **Card substitution**:
   Any card can become any other legal card with the same mana cost.
   - Example: an **Ace (1)** can represent any legal cost-1 card, like [Lightning Bolt](https://scryfall.com/search?as=grid&order=name&q=Lightning+Bolt+%28game%3Apaper%29).

3. **Mentioned cards**:
   Once a card has been mentioned, it **cannot be played again** for the rest of the match.

4. **Reshuffling**:
   When the **main deck** runs out, the graveyard is shuffled and becomes the new main deck.

---

## Restrictions

- **Graveyard**: players cannot interact with the graveyard.
- **Lands**: lands cannot be added to a player’s hand.
- **Direct damage**: opponents cannot be targeted by direct damage.
- **Hand vision**: it is not allowed to look at the opponent’s hand of cards.

---

## Competitive REL

- Card names must be memorized, otherwise it would be too easy.

## F.A.Q.

1. A creature with _persist_ that goes to the graveyard, does return to the battlefield with a -1/-1 counter due to its ability?
   No, because any card that goes to the graveyard ceases to exist and can no longer be interacted with.

2. A spell or ability that says _each opponent takes 2 damage_, is legal?
   Yes, because it does not explicitly say that it targets the opponent.

3. A spell or ability that says _Target player discards two cards_, is legal?
   Yes, because forcing a player to discard cards without looking at their hand is not prohibited by rules.
