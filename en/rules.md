## Gameplay Rules

1. **Land of the Turn**: Each turn, the player may put a card from the **land deck** into play as a land. All lands count as all basic land types and can therefore add one mana of any color.
   **At the beginning of the game**, a player may declare that all lands they play will be artifacts instead, without any basic land type.

2. **Card Substitution**: Any card can become any other legal card with the same mana value in the format. Cards may also be played with their alternative costs and can activate any other of their abilities.
   - Example: an **Ace (1)** may become any legal CMC=1 card, such as [Lightning Bolt](https://scryfall.com/search?as=grid&order=name&q=Lightning+Bolt+%28game%3Apaper%29).
   - A **Four (4)** can become a card like [Break Asunder](https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/152/break-asunder?utm_source=briscola-magic), and you may declare that you want to activate its **Cycling** ability by paying {2} and discarding it to draw a card.

3. **Mentioned Cards**: Once a card has been mentioned, it **can no longer be played** for the rest of the game.

4. **Reshuffling**: When the **main deck** runs out, the graveyard is reshuffled to become the new main deck.

## Limitations

- **Graveyard**: You can never interact with the graveyard.
- **Lands**: Lands cannot be put into your hand, nor can they be searched for from the land deck.

- **Opponent Interaction**: The rules for interacting with the opponent are modified as follows:
  - **Direct Damage**: The opponent cannot take damage from spells. Damage from abilities, however, remains legal.
  - **Hand Control**: You cannot play cards that look at the opponent’s hand or make them discard one or more cards of your choice.

---

## Competitive REL

- Card names must be memorized; otherwise, the game would be too easy.

---

### Additional Rule

- If the game lasts for a long time and both players agree, they may decide how to continue playing lands once the dedicated land deck has run out. Suggested options include:
  - Players continue to play lands using cards from another deck or with other objects.
  - Players agree to stop once each has 9 lands in play, without going beyond that.

## FAQ

1. A creature with _persist_ goes to the graveyard—does it return to play with a -1/-1 counter? **No.** Any card that goes to the graveyard ceases to exist and can no longer be interacted with.

2. A spell that says _Each opponent takes 2 damage_—is it legal? **No.** A spell cannot deal any direct damage to the opponent. Even [Searing Blaze](https://scryfall.com/card/wwk/90/searing-blaze?utm_source=briscola-magic) falls under this case: the targeted creature takes damage as normal, but the targeted player cannot take direct damage.

3. An ability of a permanent I control that says _Each opponent takes 2 damage_—is it legal? **Yes.** Permanents may deal damage to the opponent through their abilities. This is the case for [Guttersnipe](https://scryfall.com/card/pm19/145/guttersnipe?utm_source=briscola-magic), whose ability can deal direct damage to the opponent.

4. A spell or ability that says _Target player discards a card_—is it legal? **Yes.** Making a player discard cards without looking at their hand is allowed. This is the case for [Renewed Familiar](https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/105/famiglio-rinnovato?utm_source=api). However, [Duress](https://scryfall.com/card/one/92/duress?utm_source=briscola-magic) would have no effect.

5. Can I cast a spell with _Retrace_ from my graveyard? **Are you serious?** You can’t, because any card that goes to the graveyard ceases to exist. Also, since you cannot put lands into your hand, you couldn’t even pay the cost.
